### Things Worked Well:
**We used Jira to break up project into tasks and group tasks into sprints then assign them to members as sprints move on. We were comfortable using it since we can clearly see the priorities of tasks and the progresses of them as time goes on.**

**GitHub is a strong tool which we were mostly comfortable using. It helps us organizing our code, allowing members to separate into branches to work on their own part. Can be said that without GitHub, working progress will be much slower.**

**We used React Native as the framework to structure our app, JavaScript to construct frontend, Python for backend, and MongoDB for database. Overall, they are easy to use, and flexible. Construct these tools together, we are able to communicate frontend and backend and database easily.**

**We worked following agile process. We held several team meetings every week to discuss the sprint progress and problem and communicated online or in person every day to keep tracks on progress. That way, members were able to do the adjustment required in case some given or required information from their function is changed.**


### Things Didn't Work Well:
**Although git is a very useful tool, some of us not very familar with git commands, expecially for the commands that are used to resolve comflicts. Also at the begining, we didn't pay attention to git flows so that most of us just directly working on master branch, which gave us lots of conflicts and we are uncommfortable with solving them.**

**For the backend APIs, we firstly using google places API to find some places in a specific location. Then we realized that we need the duration time infomation for planing the intineray. But google API doesn't have that infomatiom, so we switched from google API to Sygic API. However, Sygic API is also not perfect, lots of places we got from Sygic don't have pictures. Finally, we conbined those two APIs, Sygic for findding places, Google for finding deatiled infomation like picture. Therefore, we wasted lots of effort and effort on swchitting around APIs.**



### Ideal Process for Our Team:
**Our teamâ€™s process has been working fine. Tasks were fairly distributed to members. Although sometimes the working burndown chart is not fluently completed, but most of our tasks are completed. If we were going to keep going, our process would continue following our agile procedure to complete the rest of tasks in Jira.**

**If we contine working as a team, we may need more APIs to complete the backend tasks. We will do enough reacherchs first, before we acturlly start using them. Spending a little more time at the begining will save more time and efforts during the process.**
