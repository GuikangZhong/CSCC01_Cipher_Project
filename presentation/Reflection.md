### Things Worked Well:





### Things Didn't Work Well:
**Althrough git is a very useful tool, some of us not vary familar with git commands, expecially for the commands are used to resolving comflicts. And at the begining, we didn't pay attention to git flows. So, most of us just directly working on master branch. Which gave us lots of conflicts and we are uncommfortable with solving them.**

**For the backend APIs, we firstly using google places API to find some place in a specific location. Then we realized that we need the during time infomation for planing the intineray. But google API doesn't have the infomatiom, so we witch the API from google API to Sygic API. However, Sygic API is also not perfect, lots of places we got from Sygic do't have pictures. In the end, we spend lots of effort on swchitting around the APIs.**
