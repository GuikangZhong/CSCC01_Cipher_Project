### Summary

Our plan for Planit is to focus on their unique selling point which is to make an application that helps our users plan the perfect trip. This means that our app will generate activities and attractions that are not cliche popular destinations. We want our users to be able to customize their trips and make planning user centred. Our key objective would be to interact with the users and create a personalized list of activities based on the users’ preferences and likings. The activity list created could be shared with friends so multiple people could view and edit it, making group trip planning much easier.

We believe that the type of user that Planit is targeting would be a tourist/someone new to a particular city who is not interested in doing a standard tour of the city but a day trip which is personalized to their likings. Additionally, fans of self-driven tours are an important component of our user base as well. Group leaders who are trying to organize a group trip can make great use of our app. After collecting the preferences from the group members, the leader can generate a list of activities for the group and change some activities without difficulties.

Scenario 1: Mike and his friend visit Los Angeles

	Before their trip, Mike are his friend Sherry are sitting down with Planit on. Mike logs in with his account name and password. On the preference selection page, they select museum, park, art galleries, sport events and opera. Then Planit prompts them to enter a location and they enter Los Angeles. Based on their selected preferences, Planit generates an itinerary  for each day of their trip (the drip duration is 9-10 days). For each day in that period, they select some activities they would like to do like going to Madame Tussauds Wax Museum on first day, watching an NBA game in Staples Center on second day etc. They notice that there are a lot of famous restaurants in LA, so they click “Restaurant” icon to search for their desired one. After finishing their plan, Mike syncs to the schedule of the plan to Sherry’s phone so that they can both check it at any time. Mike and Sherry do not want to line up for buying tickets to Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, so they click the activity and have Planit redirect them to the ticket purchase page



Scenario 2: 

    Jack is planning a vacation to Europe with his friends. He opened Planit last night, set the location to a place in France and set the time to be the date when he will arrive. Additionally, he   selected some filters, then let Planit generate an itinerary for him. He viewed the itinerary, locked in some activities, took some notes, then let Planit regenerate a new itinerary for him. He repeated this a few times and got a general idea about the popular places in France which could be a reference for his actual plan. 

    Finally, he started to plan his actual plan for a day in France. As usual, he let Planit generate a list of activities for him. Then based on the notes he had just took, he customized the list by changing some activities in the list to the activities he likes most from the notes. After planning, he exported the list of activities into his phone calendar and shared the plan to his friends.


Scenario 3:

    Bob decides to take a trip up north to yellowknife. A week before the trip takes place, Bob opened planit to see what it has to offer. After selecting where he would like to visit, some recommended preset filters pops up, as bob selected,  “heritage”, “industrial tourism”,  “nature” and “architecture”. Bob decides to remove some filters, in specific he removed the filter “extreme sports” since he does not plan to do any extreme sports. Planit generated places like Bank of Toronto Building, Back Bay Cemetery,Yellowknife Post Office and Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre.

    Bob decided that the itinerary generated was too packed. As a result, he removed the “Ingraham trail “ to give him some more time in between trips. 

    After previewing the places he’s about to go, Bob was satisfied with the trip already, but he wanted to regenerate another trip anyway just to see what’s more there to offer, but instead of coming up with a whole new trip, instead bob tapped on every location for each time interval to see what’s similar there to replace what’s in the schedule if he wants.



Summary Key principles: 

    The key principles we will follow is to provide personalized experiences with unique attractions compared to popular ones. This design should provide greater customer satisfaction compared to providing generic attractions since individuals have preferences that often do not match the experiences that generic attractions provide.
