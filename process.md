### Process

Our first task as a team was to decide all the features and formulate a list of processes that we would have to develop. We had a meeting where everyone gave their input about the plan for the project. After careful consideration of everyone’s ideas we came to an understanding about the best idea for the project. Then, we started writing a detailed list of the features for out plan. This list was the conclusion of our first meeting. 

We have had two meetings after the first one, and have decided to meet every week. In each weekly meeting, we will go over what has been completed, what needs to be completed and any roadblocks that have occured. 

At our second meeting we came up with the user stories and gave each user story priority based on how severely it affects the functioning of the application. For example the login and sign up functionality although important doesn't stop others from working on their delegated tasks, therefore it was given lower priority over other user stories.

We then delegated equal amounts of work to each of our team members to get done before the next meeting. Depending on the priority and workload of a task we delegated a certain amount of people. For example if a certain task was crucial in our development process, we would assign 3 people to it and let one person do a minor task on his own.
 
 Our decision making process often went smoothly. Even though we did have a few disagreements while choosing which application to work on, they were resolved in a professional manner after considering everyone’s opinion. 

Our development process in divided into two teams that have two roles. One team focuses on the front end while the other focuses on the backend. The front end team consists of three people and the backend team consists of four. The reason for dividing the group into these teams was the extensive need for frontend and backend equally for the planit app development. In particular, Mohan, Soham and Eric will be working on the frontend, the others will be on the backend.

For our next phase, we will start working on the basic front end for the application as well as start to work on deciding what APIs we will be using. We are also planning on setting up the basic endpoints for our APIs. 
The specific Jiras we decided to tackle were  CIP-1, CIP-2, CIP-4, and CIP-7
