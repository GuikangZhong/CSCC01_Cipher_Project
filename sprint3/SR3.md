### Sprint review 

- Sprint 2 Good things:
  - Team was working productivly, we hit our stride in sprint one and continued the velocity
  - The frontend and backend structure held up to the new features we implmented. i.e the frontend and backend were able in incorporate the new features with realtive ease 
  - Team members were helpful and insightful when trying to fix errors
  - Standup meetings went well, we were able to communicate more efficiently compared to sprint one exactly what we were working on, what we were planning on doing and our roadblocks 
  - Used gitflow effectively 
  
- Sprint 1 Bad Things:
  - Difficulties handling device permissions in frontend
  - Difficulties increasing the speed at which the backend executes its services
  - Trouble understanding the most optimal soloution (in terms of execution time and amount of work required) for generating calendar
