  - Frontend Structure and Backend Structure competed with all team members understading the project architecture. 
  - Team members were helpful and insightful when trying to fix errors
  - Large amounts of progress done, 100% completion for sprint 1
  - Held stadup meetings everyday to understand what team members were working on and what they were goint to be working on. As well as what roadblocks they have.
  
- Sprint 1 Bad Things:
  - Difficulties understanding external api and how they would fit with out codebase (e.g googleApi)
