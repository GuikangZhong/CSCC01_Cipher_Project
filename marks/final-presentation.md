- introduction:                                                             (1/1)
    - was fine
    - there is a slide with team members but none of you have any of your actual photos on it
        - presuming these are your GitHub photos
- user preferences                                                          (1/3)
    - did not appear to work properly
    - there was an error alert that appeared
- generating places to go to                                                (2/3)
    - using the sygic API to get results nearby
    - performance is not very good
        - could have used a loading screen
        - functionally does what it's supposed to though
    - difficult to see all the suggested places
        - only 3 are visible at a time; the scroll dropdown could be larger
    - navigation works but only from current location to the selected location
- feedback functionality (i.e. rating functionality)                        (1/3)
    - rudimentary rating functionality and leave comments
    - can't see the comments anywhere
        - this functionality is pretty useless; doesn't really do anything
- additional features:
    - login functionality
        - did not work on the first attempt
            - not really sure if this was a technical issue or the login credentials weren't correct

## software architecture

**total mark**: 6/10

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|architecture presented clearly, illustrated with sufficient diagrams, responsibilities shown clearly|2|4|
|technologies presented clearly, illustrated with sufficient diagrams/links/examples, technical challenges indicated clearly|4|6|

**additional comments**:

- architecture:                                                             (2/4)
    - diagram is far too simple
        - there is a lot more stuff happening and the diagram is over simplifying things
        - the diagram also doesn't really go over the specific architecture of your application
            - to be honest, this diagram could be applied to nearly any web application
    - explanations of the diagram are fine
        - the diagram is overly simple so the explanations were fairly helpful
- technologies:                                                             (4/6)
    - had a diagram of the technologies that you used but didn't really go over any of them
        - did not really go over specific use cases; just generally stated that you used these technologies
    - technological challenges:
        - went over some challenges but didn't go over any detailed solutions to your problems
            - just stating that you had to "do some more research" is a little to overly vague and could be applied to any issue
            - not a very interesting solution to your issue
        - some of the issues aren't really issues but rather kind of a lack of experience
            - e.g. wouldn't categorize not knowing git as an issue; this is something you should be learning about in class
        - some challenges didn't appear to be solved entirely
            - e.g. requests taking too long
                - said they took up to 9 seconds, still appears to take pretty long (around 4ish seconds)
                - probably better than before but still not very satisfactory
