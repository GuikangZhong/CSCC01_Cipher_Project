* Releasing Goals/Review Requirements:<br>
    1. Finish the high/very hige/medium priority user stories frist:

         * As Jack, a person is already familiar with the current city I live, I want to set specific filters so that I can get some unique experience. - Story points: 3, Priority:very high

         * As Bob, a graduate student, I want to save my preferences as sports and movies, so that I can check my preferences later. - Story points: 5, Priority:high

        * As Bob, a person did not have anything planned for the trip to the small villages in Yellowknife, I want Planit to generate a list of activities that really meets my expectation. - Story points: 20 Priority:very high

        * As a general user, I want to sign up and log in with my email or google account so that I can have personalized content. - Story points: 8,  Priority: medium

        * As Jack, a person who wants to travel to other places, I want to choose the location for my next trip, which is in 10 days so that I can plan my trip ahead. - Story points: 5, Priority:medium

        * As Bob, a person who is tired of attending normal activities, I want to edit any activities in the list generated by Planit, so that I can attend the activities I like the most. - Story points: 3 Priority: medium 

        * As Mike, who is going to Los Angeles with my old friend, I want to sync the itinerary generated by Planit not only with the calendar on my phone but also to my friend’s, so that we will be on the same page. - Story points: 5 Priority:medium

        * As Bob, who is going to have a unique experience with Planit, I want to leave comments in text, so that Planit can better understand my special taste of activities. - Story points: 5 Priority:medium

        * As a general user, who wants to use Planit for next trip again, I want to rate the itinerary generated this time, so that I can get better recommendations from Planit next time. - Story points:8 Priority:medium
    2. Once the higher priority user stories are done, finish the low and lowest priority items.
        * As Mike, without any knowledge of Los Angeles, I want to know the start time and location of some popular activities.  As well as the open hours for some famous attractions, so that I can plan my trip with a sensible pace. - Story points: 13, Priority:low
        * As Jack, who is going to a city completely new to him, I want Planit to regenerate another list of activities, so that I can have a better idea of what kind of personalized plans are available in that city on that day. - Story points: 1 Priority:low
        * As Mike, who love to see the map beforehand, I want Planit to show all the destinations of upcoming activities in an in-app map, so that I can better organize the trip. - Story points: 8 Priority:low
        * As Jack, who love self-driven trips, I want Planit to navigate to Google Maps, so that I know how to drive to the next location. - Story points: 5 Priority:low
    3. The higher priority items will be finished in early sprints (sprint1 & sprint 2) while the lower priority items will be finished in latter sprints (sprint 3 & sprint 4).
    4. After talking with Lora, she iterated to us that the goal of the release should be to create an application which is able to generate a customed itinery for users.
    5. The main dependencies from talking to Lora that we will need is a way to create a mobile application, a way to have data retention.
        * From our technical understandings, the main dependencies will be: MongoDB for data retention, React Native to create a mobile view, Flask for the backend routes/logic.

* Estimation of the requirements: (Please reference to PD.md) <br> note: one story point is half a day, half a day is 3 hours work.  

* Slotting of requirements into sprints
    * Sprint1: (Total Story Points: 38)

        * As Mike, without any knowledge of Los Angeles, I want to know the start time and location of some popular activities.  As well as the open hours for some famous attractions, so that I can plan my trip with a sensible pace. - Story points: 13, Priority:low
        * As Jack, a huge fan of basketball in Toronto, I want to add an activity at a specific time and place so that schedule generated will include an activity I wanted to attend, for example,  Raptor’s game at 7:00PM Oct.10th at Scotiabank Arena. - Story points: 3 Priority:very low

        * As a general user, who wants to use Planit for next trip again, I want to rate the itinerary generated this time, so that I can get better recommendations from Planit next time. - Story points:8 Priority:medium
    * The reason why we are doing more work on sprint1 and sprint3 is that we have reading week for sprint1 and we dont have many assignments from other courses remaining in sprint3. As for sprint2, we have midterms from other courses so we decided to reduce workloads.
    * The reason why we have less workload in sprint1 compared to sprint3 is that we have to learn dependencies before we actually start working.
