However, These applications are mainly used as a tool to help users to make decisions and keep track on their trips. Our product is not only helping users to make decision, but also making decisions for them. Users of our product can save their likes in personal profile which can be updated and customized before every trip planning action. For those people who are not familiar with a place or travelling, we give them a plan according to their likes to follow. That way, people won't continuously see the famous locations, which they don't like, of a place.

It also let the customers choose the place they don't want to visit, or the place they have visited and do not want to visit again; so that the app will not suggest and plan on the same place over and over again. Or on the other hand, users can indicate one or more places they really want to visit and focus on, our product can give best suggestions and plans of activity centered at the place.


Our product is focusing on short, one day trip. There are many scenarios our product can be used on, such as: 

- People who want to visit a place.

- People who live at the place but have not explored around, and now is taking a day off from work wishing to look around.

- People who are transferring in a place and have a couple of hours to spare.

- etc

In addition, our product can be used on many types of people:

- People who like to travel a lot and know where they want to visit. They can use our product find the place, book tickets, and plan their trip in calendar.

- People who don't travel much but know something about the place, maybe a famous church or whatever. They can book tickets and do planning on app themselves, or they can ask app to generate a trip for them according to their likes.

- People who have no idea about the place. We can plan the trip for them according to their interest and time, making sure they discover the specialist of the place.

The most of the applications which exist focus on long time travel instead of short tour. Maybe they felt that people don't usually plan on a short trip, they can do the idea pops up in their mind. However, that idea of killing time is difficult; And they often end up with finding a seat diving in their phone.
