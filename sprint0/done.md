### Done

After the first sprint meeting, the whole team are all agreed that our project is done only if our product owners are satisfied with the product before the deadline. For user stories in general, a story is considered done if the code has been thoroughly tested, performs the necessary functionality, and has been code reviewed and approved by two other team members.

In our assumption, our product is done when user can perform the list of tasks included below:
* Log in with Google account or create Planit Account with emails.
* Save preference in Planit
* Choose Location as “interested going”
* Set specific filters for a trip 
* Get a generated list of activities from Planit
* Edit the itinerary to improve the plan
* Sync the itinerary to the calendar app on my phone
* See activities shown on the in-app map
* Redirect to Google Map for Navigation
* Leave comments for the trip or an individual event

However, our expectations may differ from what our product owners. The whole group is agreed on that we will always go to our customers for approval before each sprint is done.
